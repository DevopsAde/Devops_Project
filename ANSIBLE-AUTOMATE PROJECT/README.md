# Ansible Configuration Management 

- In this project we are going to experience the power of automation with Ansible by simplifying complex tasks and streamlining

- What is Ansible?

Ansible is an open-source software platform utilized for automating configuration management. It is renowned for its scalability, flexibility, and

ease of use, and is widely used in various industries such as finance, healthcare, and technology. In 2015, it was acquired by Red Hat, Inc. and has 

since become one of the leading automation tools in the market.

It uses YAML, a simple and powerful language for describing automation tasks declaratively, which makes it easy to understand and maintain.
