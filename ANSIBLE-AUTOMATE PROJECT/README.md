# Ansible Configuration Management 

- In this project we are going to experience the power of automation with Ansible by simplifying complex tasks and streamlining 

an IT infrastructure.

- What is Ansible?

Ansible is an open-source software platform utilized for automating configuration management. It is renowned for its scalability, flexibility, and

ease of use, and is widely used in various industries such as finance, healthcare, and technology. In 2015, it was acquired by Red Hat, Inc. and has 

since become one of the leading automation tools in the market.

It uses YAML, a simple and powerful language for describing automation tasks declaratively, which makes it easy to understand and maintain.

- Why Use Ansible?

There are several compelling reasons why Ansible is a popular choice for automation, configuration management, and application deployment. 

The following are some of the key benefits of using Ansible:

It is easy to learn and use. It employs a simple yet powerful language known as YAML to describe automation tasks in a declarative way, making it easy to understand and maintain.

It is agentless. This means that it does not require any software to be installed on the target servers, making it simple to set up and use.

Easy to scale. Ansible is scalable and designed to handle large-scale IT environments with ease.

It is flexible. Ansible is flexible and can be used for a variety of tasks, including configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration.

It is highly extensible. It can be customized with plugins and modules to suit specific needs.

It is community-driven. It has a vibrant and active community that contributes to the platform's development, provides support, and creates new modules and plugins.
