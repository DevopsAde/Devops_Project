# Understanding Client Server Architecture with MySQL as RDBMS

- In this topic we going to gain a comprehensive understanding of data management, connectivity, and communication

between clients and servers.

First let's define what actually a Client and Server is?

- Client: A client is a user or system that requests a specific resource or service from another entity know as server

**WHILE**

- SERVER: Is a resource or service provider that listens for incoming requests from clients and responds to those requests.                                        

## Client-Server Architecture with MySQL

*What is Client-Server Architecture* : Client-Server refers to an architecture in which two or more computers

are connected together over a network to send and receive requests between one another.

- Example: **`MACHINE A`** sending requests is called CLIENT & **`MACHINE B`** responding (serving the request) is called SERVER. 

Below is an explanatory diagram of a Client and Server Requests and Responses.
