# Implementing Load Balancers with Nginx

- In this project, we going to learn how to distribute traffic efficiently across multiple servers, optimize

performance, and ensure high availability for your web applications.

## Introduction to Load Balancing and Nginx

- **`What is Load Balancing`**?

In simple terms, load balancing means distributing the work or tasks among several computers or servers so 

that no computer gets overloaded with too much work. This helps to keep everything running smoothly and ensures

that websites and apps work quickly and don't get too slow.

Modern high-traffic websites must serve hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of concurrent  requests from 

users or clients and return the correct text, images, video, or application data, all in a fast and reliable 

manner. To cost-effectively scale to meet these high volumes, modern computing best practice generally requires adding

more servers.

A **`Load balancer`** acts as the "traffic cop" sitting in front of your servers and routing client requests across

all servers capable of fulfilling those requests in a manner that maximizes speed and capacity utilization and ensures

that no one server is overworked, which could degrade performance. If a single server goes down, the load balancer

redirects traffic to the remaining online servers. When a new server is added to the server group, the load balancer 

automatically starts to send request to it.

# In this steps, a load balancer performs the following functions:

- Distributes client requests or network load efficiently across multiple servers.

- Ensures high availability and reliability by sending requests only yo servers that are online.

- Provides the flexibility to add or subtract servers as demand dictates.

# Benefits of Load Balancing

- Reduced downtime

- Scalable

- Redundancy

- Flexibility

- Efficiency

# How NGINX can Help?

- Nginx is a versatile software, it can act like a **`webserver, reverse proxy, and a load balancer`**.

**`NGINX`** is the best-in-class load-balancing solutions used by high-traffic websites such as Dropbox, Netflix, and

Zynga. More than 350 million websites worldwide rely on NGINX to deliver their content quickly, reliably, and securely.

The comprehensive load balancing capabilities in NGINX enables you to build a high optimized application delivery network.

When you insert NGINXas a load balancer in front of your application and server, it increases your website's efficiency, 

performance, and reliability. NGINX helps in maximizing customer satisfaction and return on IT investments.
